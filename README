Snitch sits in freenode, snatch sits on irc.wikimedia.org

INSTALLATION
1) Edit the settings.py.example file appropriately and rename it to settings.py
2) Run snitchbot.py
3) Join #snitch-test on freenode and do a !join #channelyouwant the bot to join
4) Do a !part on #snitch-test
5) Enjoy :)

It's probably best to just edit the sqlite3 file to make it join directly the channel you want.
