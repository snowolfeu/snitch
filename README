This is snitchbot, a simple edit reporter

snitch sits in freenode, snatch sits in wikimedia irc. Use the existing sample settings file and replace nickname = '<Replace with Bot Nick>' in the snitchbot.py to get started.

The example database file will make the bot autojoin #snitch from where you can get him to join the channels that you want and so on.
