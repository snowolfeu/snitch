2) Edit snitchbot.py replacing <Replace with Bot Nick> with your bot's nickname (both on row 78 and row 172)
3) Run snitchbot.py
4) Join #snitch-test on freenode and do a !join #channelyouwant the bot to join
5) Do a !part on #snitch-test

It's probably best to just edit the .db file to make it join directly the channel you want.
